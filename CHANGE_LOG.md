[V3.0.1]

[V3.0.0]

Changed:

- the shader z-fighting fix no longer expands the model leading to weird rendering, emissives should no longer z-fight
  for most mobs while using shaders.(option has been removed)
- illegal identifier fix changed to only affect image files, cause of litematica conflicts
- Optifine parity: Name property now works identical to optifine
- ETF supports a new Names (plural) property using previous ETF name behaviour
- names property will also match against the whole line ((names.1=john smith) will check the names {"john", "smith" & "
  john smith"})

Added:
- Optifine parity: Size & Color texture properties
- Ender Dragon random / custom and emissive texture support
- drowned outer layers support random and emissive textures using the vanilla format
- choice between brighter or optifine-like(default) emissive rendering modes (bright usually provides bigger bloom with
  shaders and is noticeably brighter in sunlight)

- block entity random/custom texture support for: chests, shulker boxes & beds
- custom lectern book texture support with "minecraft/textures/entity/lectern_book.png"
